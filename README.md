# Blockchain_Python
Building Smart Contracts, DApps(using Ethereum) and blocks in Blockchain using Python.  


Blockchain_Initialation - Creating Blocks using python. This is a simple Block which can be used to transfer data.

Blockchaib_Transaction - Transfers data to be transferred by the blocks initialized by Blockchain_Initialization.

EthereumNode - We initialize an Ethereum Node in Infura and connect to this node. We check the balance of our metamask account. We finally then use our Ethereum Node to gain access to a smart contract hosted online by Etherscan. Data like name, symbol and account balance etc are obtained. Important to note that we need the address and abi of the smart contract(OMG in our case) hosted by Etherscan.

SmartContract_Python - We are creating a simple python smart-contract to transfer blocks from one node to another. Here we are using Ganache to obtain addresses of the blocks and transfer blocks. Ganache also helps in maintaining a record of number of transactions made and the balance(in Eth) of each node.
